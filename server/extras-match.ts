/**
 * Compares what the listener (eyes.py) read and heard in an extra with the bonus-feature names DVD
 * Fandom lists for its movie, and says whether one of them is clearly it.
 *
 * Two kinds of evidence: how long the extra is against the length a database gives the feature (the
 * only evidence there is when nothing is written or said), and what the listener read and heard.
 * Like Shelver's auto-match it is careful: a name is suggested only when the evidence is clear (the
 * only listed feature of that length, or the title card reads it, or it is said and also written,
 * and nothing else fits nearly as well), and every answer says why. Extras of one length cannot be
 * told apart by length, so those are decided by what was read and heard, or left for a person. Everything else is left for the person, with what was seen and heard, so
 * they still have something to go on. Nothing is renamed by this; a person presses a button.
